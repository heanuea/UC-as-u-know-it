###Project overview 

I had a creators block and took a while even to think what my Single page application should be.
But i had orignally was thinking of a getting a game using [Canvas](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) but time was against me.
With trying to learn new languages like [Python](https://www.python.org)and [Flask](flask.pocoo.org) i knew i would have little time.
So i choose something that i live with and a nothing to complicated so a blog is what i went for at the end.
