###Project overview 

I had a creators block and took a while even to think what my Single page application should be.
But i had orignally was thinking of a getting a game using [Canvas](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) but time was against me.
With trying to learn new languages like [Python](https://www.python.org)and [Flask](flask.pocoo.org) i knew i would have little time.
So i choose something that i live with and a nothing to complicated so a blog is what i went for at the end. 

###Members 
Im working by myself i decided to learn some aspects better for this module .

###Technologies Used


####Cmdr 

An alternative console for windows great for running [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
cURL is a command line tool for getting or sending files using URL syntax, which we need for this project as we 
are using client to server connections. Widely used for transferring data and scripts.





####Python 
               (Flask)
Flask is a Python framework for creating web applications. 
Flask is easier to get started with, when compared to Django



####MongoDB

 MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents that can vary in structure. Related information is stored together for fast query access through the MongoDB query language. MongoDB uses dynamic schemas, meaning that you can create records without first defining the structure, such as the fields or the types of their values. You can change the structure of records (which we call documents) simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones. This data model give you the ability to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures easily. Documents in a collection need not have an identical set of fields and denormalization of data is common. MongoDB was also designed with high availability and scalability in mind, and includes out-of-the-box replication and auto-sharding.
 
 Advantages over sql ------
 MongoDBâ€™s flexible data model also means that your database schema can evolve with business requirements. For example, schema changes that took days of weeks in The Weather Channel's MySQL databases could be made in just hours with MongoDB.
